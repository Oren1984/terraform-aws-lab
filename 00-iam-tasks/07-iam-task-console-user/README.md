# 07 - IAM Task - Console User

## 🎯 Task Objective
Create an IAM User with access to the AWS Console, using Terraform.

## 📄 Terraform Configuration

**File:** `main.tf`

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "console_user" {
  name = "console-user"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_login_profile" "console_user_password" {
  user                    = aws_iam_user.console_user.name
  password_reset_required = true
}
🛠️ Steps Performed
Created a folder 07-iam-task-console-user

Created main.tf file with the configuration above

Ran:
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
Confirmed the IAM user was created with AWS Console access.

✅ Validation
Checked that the user console-user was created in the AWS Console.

Confirmed it has a login profile and a reset-required password.

📌 Notes
No password was explicitly set in the Terraform file (it's randomly generated by AWS).

For real-world use, attach policies or groups to control permissions.
