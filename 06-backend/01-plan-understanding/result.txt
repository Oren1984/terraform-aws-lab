Terraform Plan – Task 31: Understanding `terraform plan`

✅ Plan executed successfully.

Summary:
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + bucket_name = "oren-tf-plan-demo-bucket"

No resources were actually created, as this was only a dry-run (`terraform plan`).

Note:
To ensure this exact plan is applied later, you can run:
terraform plan -out=tfplan
